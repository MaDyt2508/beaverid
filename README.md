# BeaverID
Beaver-ID Project code repository. Individual recognition of Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) by their tail pattern using a computer-assisted pattern-identification algorithm.

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a computer-assisted pattern-identification algorithm to recognize individual Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) based on their unique tail patterns. 


# Pre-Requisites

* opencv https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
* scikit-learn https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/
* matplotlib https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/
* ipywidgets https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/

# Run
```
git clone https://github.com/cllom/beaverid
```
Run beaverid.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
or run beaverid.py.

# Data set
The data set was collected with diverse range of individuals and has benn preprocess by removing any noice or irrelevant information. Manually annotate the tail patterns of each beaver in the dataset to create a labeled dataset for training and evaluation.

# Objective of the codes
Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive datase, the dataset should include a diverse range of individuals.

Testing and Validation: Evaluate the trained algorithm using the validation set to assess its ability to recognize individual Eurasian beavers accurately. Measure key performance metrics such as accuracy to quantify the algorithm's effectiveness.
Individually indentify unseen image of beaver tail patter.
